# Iris Dataset Analysis

This project performs basic data exploration, analysis, and visualization on the Iris dataset using Python.

## Project Overview

- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Perform basic statistical analysis.
- Visualize data through line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Identify insights from the dataset.

## Files

- `iris_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis steps and visualizations.
- `iris.csv`: The Iris dataset CSV file (download separately if needed).

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required libraries if you don't have them:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Download the Iris dataset CSV file from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv

Place iris.csv in the same directory as iris_analysis.ipynb.

Open and run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook iris_analysis.ipynb
Key Findings
Different Iris species show distinct petal and sepal length patterns.

The distribution of sepal length is approximately normal.

Cumulative petal length shows a steady upward trend across the dataset.
